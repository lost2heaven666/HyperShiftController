# HyperShiftController

このアプリを作るきっかけになったのは
Razerのマウス「Naga Trinity」を長年愛用していたことでした

かなり気に入って使っていたのですが
最近ついに壊れてしまいました

新品を買い直そうとしたところ
自分が使っていたボタン配置とは違うものしか見つからず
いろいろ探しても選択肢はほとんどありませんでした

中古サイトも確認しましたが
すでに入手困難な状態でした

仕方なく似たタイプのNagaシリーズを購入してみたのですが
こちらはSynapse 2専用で
Synapse 3には対応しておらず
さらに中クリックも使えない仕様でした

HyperShiftが使えない
この時点で正直
【終わったー…】
と思いました

ただキー入力自体は認識されていたため
試しに昔購入していた中華製のフットペダルに
F13キーを割り当ててみることにしました

設定画面上ではキー名も表示されず
正直あまり期待していなかったのですが
保存して実際に押してみたところ
F13キーが普通に使えることが分かりました
F14キーも同様に中クリックとして使えました

この時
キー入力さえ取れれば
まだやりようがある
と気づいたのが最初の転機です

同じような機能を
自分で作ればいけるんじゃないか
そう思って
試しに作り始めました

最初は
同じ機能があればそれでいい
という軽い気持ちでした

でも作っているうちに
自分で欲しい機能をどんどん足していき
そのうち
これ…そもそも
自分で作る必要なくないか…
似たアプリあるんじゃないか…
と思って探してみました

実際に似たものはありました
ただどれも
自分の使いたい感じとは
少し違いました

だったらもう
このまま自分で欲しい機能を
全部入れてしまおう
そう思いました

ゲームで規約違反にならない範囲で
こういうのがあったら
不便じゃなくなるな…
と思った機能を足していった結果
気づいたら
あれ…これ実は
めちゃくちゃ便利なのでは
という状態になっていました

これ
同じような機能を
欲しがっている人
普通にいるんじゃないか
そう思ったのが
公開しようと思った理由です

実は
C#を触り始めた理由は
これとは別にあります

もともと
AIが会話の記憶を失うことに不便さを感じていて
忘れないAIを自分用に作りたい
と思ったのがきっかけでした

ただC#初心者だった私は
WPF地獄に何度も心を折られ
何度もやめようと思いました

最終的には
軽いAIを一応作ることはできましたが
これを最後まで作るには
相当なお金と時間が必要だと途中で気づき
一度休憩として
ゲームや趣味の時間に戻ることにしました

――その矢先です

マウスが壊れました
しかも課金したその日です
正直
ひどい…まじかよ…
と思いました

そこで発想を切り替え
無いなら自分で作ろう
そう考えて作り始めたのが
この
【Hyper Shift Controller】
です

このツールはあくまで
自分の環境を取り戻すために作ったもので
最初から
公開や配布を目的としたものではありません

ですが
同じような不便さを感じている人が
いるかもしれない
そう思い
現在はフリーソフトとして公開しています

ちなみに
金蛇神社のおみくじでは
【大大吉】が出ました

内容は
――
光輝く大勢運
金蛇大神の導きありて
地道な努力と
持ち前の才能が花開き
金運につながるとき
感謝の気持ちと思いやりで
さらなる幸福に満たされる
――
と書いてありました

……らしいです

今のところ
お金は羽を生やして
元気に飛んでいっています
💰🪽💨😭

マウスが壊れる
充電器が壊れる
USBケーブルも壊れる
パナソニックのドアホンが壊れる
履いていたお気に入りの靴まで壊れる始末です

盛ってません
本当です
ガチです

全部買い替えることになり
お金がなくなっています…

この
【Hyper Shift Controller】
が誰かの困りごとの役に立ち
それが少しでも
自分に返ってきたとしたら
このおみくじが本当だったという
証明になるのかもしれませんねｗ

🇺🇸 English Version

The reason I started making this app
was because I had been using a Razer mouse
the Naga Trinity
for many years

I really liked it
but recently it finally broke

When I tried to buy a new one
I couldn’t find the same button layout I had been using
and no matter how much I searched
there were almost no real options left

I checked used markets as well
but it was already hard to find

So I bought a similar Naga model
but it only worked with Synapse 2
did not support Synapse 3
and even the middle click was unusable

No HyperShift
At that point I honestly thought
well… it’s over

However the key inputs themselves were still recognized
so I tried assigning F13 to an old foot pedal
that I had bought years ago

The settings screen didn’t even show the key name
so I wasn’t expecting much
but after saving and pressing it
I realized F13 worked normally
F14 also worked as a middle click

That was the first turning point
As long as I could capture key input
there was still a way forward

I thought
maybe I could just make something myself
and started experimenting

At first
I only wanted the same basic functionality
nothing more

But as I kept building
I kept adding features I personally wanted
and at some point I thought
wait…
do I really need to make this myself
aren’t there already similar apps

There were
but none of them felt quite right for how I wanted to use them

So I decided
if that’s the case
I’ll just put everything I want into it myself

As long as it stays within game rules
I kept adding features that would remove small frustrations
and before I knew it
I realized
this is actually… really convenient

I started thinking
there are probably other people
who want something like this too
and that’s why I decided to release it

The reason I originally started learning C#
was actually unrelated

I was frustrated with AI systems
that forget conversations
and wanted to build a personal AI that wouldn’t forget

But as a beginner
I got mentally destroyed by WPF many times
and almost gave up more than once

I did manage to build a small AI in the end
but I realized finishing it properly
would require a lot of money and time
so I took a break
and went back to games and hobbies

Then
my mouse broke

On the exact day I had spent money
Honestly
it felt pretty cruel

So I changed my mindset
If it doesn’t exist
I’ll just make it myself

That’s how
Hyper Shift Controller
was born

This tool was originally made
only to restore my own setup
and was never intended for public release

But I thought
there might be others
who feel the same inconvenience
so I decided to release it as free software

By the way
I once drew a fortune at a shrine
and it said
Great fortune
efforts will bloom
and lead to prosperity

So far
my money has grown wings
and flown away at full speed

Mouse broken
charger broken
USB cable broken
even my favorite shoes broke

No exaggeration
This is real

If
Hyper Shift Controller
ends up helping someone
and something comes back to me because of it
maybe that fortune was actually telling the truth
